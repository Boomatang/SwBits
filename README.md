# Solidworks Functions

This is a collection of Solidworks marcos to preform task that I have required before.


## How to use
The main function to be ran is called main. There is a number of things that will be done when this function is ran.

- The layers that have been configured in the config file gets loaded into drawing layers
- All the annotation on all the drawing sheets gets changed to the layer that is stated but the other config file.
- Then any extra layers are removed.

The macro is by far not finished and there is may issue that still need to be fixed. Below is a list of annotation it currently will work with.

## Version

### V0.2
- More default layers added.
- Center Lines get placed on the configured layer.

### V0.1
- Dimensions, it will change all types of dimensions to the same layer. There function to distinguee between dimensions is not there yet.

## To conclude
As you may see there is a lot of annotation's missing as of yet but it is a depth rabbit hole trying to find ID numbers for the annotation's

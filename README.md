This is a collection of Solidworks marcos to proform task that I have required before.


## How to use
The main function to be ran is called main. There is a number of things that will be done when this function is ran.

- The layers that have been configured in the config file gets loaded to a drawing
- All the annotation on all the drawing sheets gets changed to the layer that is stated but the other config file.
- Then any extra layers are re moved.

- Dimensions, it will change all types of dimensions to the same layer. There function to distenuse between dimensions is not there yet.

# This config file is for setting up the layers for which the Drafting standards will be set.
# This File has been set up to work with Solidworks 2013. 
# It may work with others but this may not be the case.

# All the settings here are not designed to replace the buildin darfting standards.
# Its use is to help fix misstakes with what layers have been assigned to the annotations.

# Comments are marked with the # and are ingored at runtime.

# The following block will set the top level layer for that group. 
# This section is run first and allows the user set all layers.
# Doing this allows the spific drafting standards to be set afterwards.

# The main layers that have been set in this config file are designed to
# used with the "layers config" and the marco that was used to set them up.

# ~~~~~~~~ Main Layers ~~~~~~~~~~
# Please do not uncomment any of the values here.
# These get set every time the config runs
